## 🎯 Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of system prompts and prompt engineering techniques for various large language models (LLMs). The prompts are organized by AI model and complexity level, ranging from basic instructions to advanced system prompts with internal monologues and complex rule sets.

### Supported AI Models

- **Anthropic**: Claude models and variants
- **Google**: Gemini models and variants
- **OpenAI**: GPT models and variants
- **Perplexity**: Perplexity AI models
- **Proton**: Proton's AI services
- **xAI**: Grok and other xAI models
- **Misc**: Other models and platforms

Each directory contains model-specific prompts with their own README.md explaining the model's characteristics and prompt styles.

## 🏷️ File Naming Convention

All markdown files follow a consistent naming pattern for clarity and easy navigation:

```
[model-name]-[version]-[topic].md
```

**Examples:**
- `claude-4.1-opus-thinking.md`
- `gpt-5-listener-personality.md`
- `gemini-pro-json-formatter.md`

## 📚 Prompt Categories

### Foundational Prompts
Simple, direct instructions that demonstrate basic prompt engineering principles. These establish baseline behaviors for each model.

### Intermediate Prompts
More complex prompts requiring specific formatting, multi-step reasoning, or structured outputs. These showcase how prompts can elicit procedural or formatted responses.

### Advanced System Prompts
Sophisticated prompts with detailed personas, internal monologues, and complex rule sets. These demonstrate advanced prompt engineering techniques including:
- Chain of thought reasoning
- Role-playing with detailed personas
- Internal monologue simulation
- Multi-layered instruction sets

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions of new prompts, improvements to existing ones, and documentation enhancements. Please ensure:

1. Follow the established file naming convention
2. Include clear descriptions of each prompt's purpose
3. Test prompts with the target model when possible
4. Maintain the educational and research focus
